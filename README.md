# DEVOops

Goal is to make a dev **faster** than the next. 

Setup & Usage
---

>[!TIP]
> None of these scripts require sudo.

1st: `./deps` to check you have all needed.

2nd: `./setup_vs` which downloads latest release of VSCodium installs to `/opt/vscodium`

> Open vscodium once to generate the `/home/user/.vscode-oss` folder.

3rd: `./setup_asap` an extension heavily inspired by David P. Cahill `Select after paste` but in raw JS.

Other tweaks
---

- Auto indent after paste
- Zsh integration to VSCodium terminal
